# Generative_AI_with_Anti-Malarial_Drug_Discovery
##Malaria is one of the most severe infectious diseases in the world. Due to the spread of drug resistance to the marketed antimalarial drugs, the discovery and development of new antimalarial drugs is one of the most pressing challenges. QSAR plays a crucial role in the field of drug design; however, to build QSAR models will involve applying a descriptor selection algorithm to find descriptors from large and diverse datasets. In addition, the descriptors are hard to explain as they are related to the target activity and are indirect representations of chemical structures. As a result, it is difficult and time-consuming to find descriptors to build QSAR models from large datasets.
